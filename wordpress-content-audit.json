Severely affected children (CF limiting daily activities &#8220;a lot&#8221;) escalate costs to £645/month, with 59% of adults with CF reporting income reductions from unpaid leave or reduced work hours[1]. In the U.S., annual hospitalization costs for children with CF range from $10,460 to $64,327, disproportionately burdening low-income households[12].</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Health System Costs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>CF care consumes $526.76–$672.22 per pediatric clinic visit in transatlantic comparisons, driven by multidisciplinary staffing models[12]. Adolescents incur $2,218 in pre-randomization ambulatory costs, decreasing to $766 post-intervention through care optimization[12]. Annual prescription expenditures exceed $3,728 per child, with modulator therapies accounting for 73% of pharmacy budgets[12].</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">National Economic Impact</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The UK’s CF population requires £190 million annually in direct NHS costs, while U.S. systems allocate $6.8 billion for CF-related hospitalizations and $2.1 billion for outpatient care[12][16].

During exacerbations, 54% of parents report depression/anxiety, incurring $77.25 in emergency care and $894.16 in office visit costs per episode[3][9]. Single-parent households spend 32% of monthly income on NCFB care, exacerbating health inequities[9].</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Provider Expenditures</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>NCFB management costs U.S. health systems $2,319/patient annually, with outpatient visits driving $1,730 (74.6%) of expenditures[2].

Research highlights how this issue fuels burnout, erodes job satisfaction, and creates cycles of frustration that ripple through care teams. Here&#8217;s what the evidence shows and how healthcare systems can respond.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Burnout Crisis in Respiratory Care</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Respiratory therapists, nurses, and physicians report <strong>burnout rates of 47–79%</strong> [4][13], far higher than many other professions. Key drivers include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Endless cycles of non-adherence</strong>: Repeated encounters with patients who skip inhaler doses or ignore treatment plans lead to emotional exhaustion. One study found that 63% of clinicians felt &#8220;powerless&#8221; when patients didn&#8217;t follow advice, worsening stress levels[12].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staffing shortages</strong>: Over 70% of respiratory therapists say understaffing leaves them unable to provide adequate education, amplifying feelings of inadequacy[4][16].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Moral distress</strong>: Watching preventable hospitalizations due to missed treatments triggers guilt and detachment. Nurses in respiratory units report 30% higher anxiety scores than peers in other specialties[5][13].</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Job Satisfaction Takes a Hit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When patients don’t adhere to treatments, HCPs often blame themselves—even when systemic issues are at play. Surveys reveal:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fading motivation</strong>: 41% of respiratory therapists considered leaving their jobs after pandemic surges, citing &#8220;pointless efforts&#8221; as a top reason[12][16].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Strained patient relationships</strong>: Non-adherence can lead to conflict. For example, 45% of asthma educators admitted using authoritarian tactics (e.g., threats about worsening health) out of frustration, despite knowing these approaches backfire[10][12].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Administrative overload</strong>: Paperwork for managing non-adherence (e.g., tracking missed appointments) consumes 2–3 hours daily for many clinicians, reducing time for meaningful patient interactions[7][18].</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Frustration Cycle: How Non-Adherence Spirals</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Initial optimism</strong>: Clinicians invest time explaining inhaler techniques or lifestyle changes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Repeated setbacks</strong>: Patients return with worsened symptoms, often due to inconsistent treatment use.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emotional withdrawal</strong>: To cope, HCPs may emotionally detach—a protective mechanism that harms care quality. For example, burned-out clinicians spend 28% less time on patient education[4][13].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Worsening adherence</strong>: Rushed consultations and less empathy make patients less likely to follow advice, perpetuating the cycle[5][12].</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<p>[key_insight]<br />\nLow adherence creates a destructive cycle where healthcare professionals experience burnout, which leads to reduced quality of care, which further decreases patient adherence. Breaking this cycle requires addressing both patient adherence and clinician well-being simultaneously.<br />\n[/key_insight]</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breaking the Cycle: Solutions That Work</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare teams are finding innovative ways to address these challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Peer support networks</strong>: Hospitals with structured peer mentoring report 27% lower burnout rates. Regular debrief sessions help clinicians share strategies and feel less isolated[12][20].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tech to the rescue</strong>: Digital tools like inhaler sensors provide real-time adherence data, reducing guesswork. One platform cut prescription errors by 23% by flagging patterns (e.g., missed doses)[17][18].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flexible workflows</strong>: Clinics using &#8220;adherence navigators&#8221; (non-clinical staff who handle follow-ups) saw a 14% drop in clinician burnout. This frees HCPs to focus on complex cases[16][18].</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reframing training</strong>: Workshops teaching HCPs to view non-adherence as a systemic issue (not patient failure) reduced frustration scores by 30% in a Saudi Arabian trial[1][13].</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>[stats_cards]<br />\n  [stat value=&#8221;27%&#8221; label=&#8221;Lower burnout rates with peer mentoring&#8221; color=&#8221;green&#8221;]<br />\n  [stat value=&#8221;23%&#8221; label=&#8221;Reduction in prescription errors with digital tools&#8221; color=&#8221;emerald&#8221;]<br />\n  [stat value=&#8221;14%&#8221; label=&#8221;Drop in clinician burnout with adherence navigators&#8221; color=&#8221;cyan&#8221;]<br />\n[/stats_cards]</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking Ahead: A Call for Systemic Change</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The link between patient adherence and clinician well-being is undeniable. Improving the quality of life for patients and families, fostering higher levels of voluntary compliance, and cultivating positive psychology toward treatment could make a tremendous positive impact on healthcare professionals&#8217; well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When patients engage willingly with their treatment plans:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Clinicians experience greater job satisfaction and reduced burnout</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The frustrating cycle of non-adherence and deteriorating care quality breaks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Healthcare teams can focus on proactive care rather than crisis management</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The entire therapeutic relationship transforms from confrontational to collaborative</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By tackling the roots of non-adherence through patient-centered approaches, healthcare systems create environments where both patients and providers thrive. This requires systemic changes including:</p>\n\n\n<p>[stats_cards]<br />\n  [stat value=&#8221;Better digital tools&#8221; label=&#8221;to make staffing more efficient and prevent overload&#8221; color=&#8221;blue&#8221;]<br />\n  [stat value=&#8221;Investment in adherence&#8221; label=&#8221;tech and solutions like Playphysio that simplifies tracking&#8221; color=&#8221;purple&#8221;]<br />\n[/stats_cards]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the solution requires a dual focus: supporting healthcare professionals with adequate resources while simultaneously empowering patients to take ownership of their health journey. This holistic approach promises not just better clinical outcomes, but a more sustainable and fulfilling healthcare experience for everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Inspired by insights from frontline clinicians and health systems worldwide.</em></p>\n\n\n<p>[references]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;1&#8243; url=&#8221;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11031990/&#8221;]Asthma medication adherence, control, and psychological symptoms[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;4&#8243; url=&#8221;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10171344/&#8221;]Enhancing Respiratory Therapists&#8217; Well-Being: Battling Burnout in &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;5&#8243; url=&#8221;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.902673/full&#8221;]Psychological Responses of Health Care Workers Are Strongly &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;7&#8243; url=&#8221;https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/60/11/1556&#8243;]Respiratory Therapist Job Perceptions: The Impact of Protocol Use[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;10&#8243; url=&#8221;https://www.madinamerica.com/2019/02/doctors-authoritarians-harmful/&#8221;]Why Many Doctors Are Authoritarians – and Harmful &#8211; Mad In America[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;12&#8243; url=&#8221;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0312504&#8243;]A qualitative study examining stressors among Respiratory &#8230; &#8211; PLOS[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;13&#8243; url=&#8221;https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1434472/full&#8221;]Association of burnout and working environment conditions in &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;16&#8243; url=&#8221;https://scholarworks.waldenu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=17300&#038;context=dissertations&#8221;][PDF] Effective Strategies Respiratory Managers Use to Reduce Burnout &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;17&#8243; url=&#8221;https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6364097/&#8221;]Digital technologies and adherence in respiratory diseases: the road &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;18&#8243; url=&#8221;https://www.motics.ai/blog/combating-clinician-burnout-in-healthcare-with-ai-causes-impact-and-solutions&#8221;]Combating Clinician Burnout in Healthcare with AI: Causes, Impact &#8230;[/ref]<br />\n[ref id=&#8221;20&#8243; url=&#8221;https://nrtimes.co.uk/peer-support-can-reduce-healthcare-burnout-npstory/&#8221;]Peer support &#8216;can reduce healthcare burnout&#8217; &#8211; NR Times[/ref]<br />\n[/references]</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

This gap is costly because 70% of all healthcare costs are due to the management of chronic conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children with chronic conditions face lifelong adherence challenges. Fear of procedures or burnout from daily routines (like physiotherapy or inhaled medicines) can derail compliance. At Playphysio, we’ve spent seven years designing games and playful tools that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Transform daunting tasks into <strong>co designed and child centered</strong> fun and games.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use gamification and reward to <strong>maintain adherence</strong> with complex treatments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Foster <strong>peer support</strong> through collaborative games for children with similar conditions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support parents who are emotionally drained from the burden of care. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Support clinicians with evidence, so that they can observer how their interventions are delivering intended health benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These approaches align with the Cambridge report’s emphasis on play as a tool for <strong>emotional resilience</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong>. When children associate care with curiosity rather than fear, adherence improves—a principle validated by partnerships with NHS trusts and global hospitals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about the Cambridge report and find out how  <a href=\"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/play-humanises-paediatric-care-and-should-be-key-feature-of-a-child-friendly-nhs-report-0\">Play &#8216;humanises&#8217; paediatric care and should be key feature of a child-friendly NHS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pedalhub.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/PEDAL-Playing-with-childrens-health.pdf\">Click here to download the report &#8220;Playing with Childrens&#8217; Health?&#8221;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The core message was that involving patients meaningfully leads to better health outcomes, more effective products, and increased efficiency within the healthcare system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s bring this concept into sharper focus by considering a specific area: Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder requiring complex, often lifelong, treatment regimens. The daily burden on patients is significant, making patient engagement not just desirable, but essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and other leading organizations have long recognized this. They champion patient involvement in developing new therapies, designing clinical trials, and creating support programs. But it goes beyond that. Actively engaging patients in understanding and adhering to their treatment routines is crucial. This means:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Co-designing interventions:</strong> Working with patients to develop treatment plans and tools that fit seamlessly into their lives, addressing their specific challenges and preferences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Education and empowerment:</strong> Providing patients with the knowledge and skills they need to manage their condition effectively and advocate for their needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Peer support:</strong> Facilitating connections between patients to share experiences, offer encouragement, and learn from one another.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By prioritizing patient engagement in CF care, we can improve adherence to treatment, enhance quality of life, and ultimately, improve outcomes. The principles of PPI, as discussed previously, are amplified in the context of chronic conditions like CF, where the patient&#8217;s voice must be at the center of care and innovation. Let&#8217;s continue to learn from and with CF patients to drive meaningful progress in their care.</p>\n",

It can be incredibly daunting when you start to realise the sheer volume of things you just don&#8217;t know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you&#8217;re a product person, you may not be comfortable with accounting and business development. If you&#8217;re a sales person you may not have a clue how software development, electronics and version control is handled. If you&#8217;re a software person, then you may need to deal with customer support, prospects and physical logistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these new areas has its own language, including endless acronyms, which are probably annoyingly similar or the same as ones you already know but have completely different meanings in different areas. Be very careful in trying to assume what an acronym means in a new area &#8211; be brave and just ask those &#8216;stupid questions&#8217; so what do you actually mean by &#8216;SOP&#8217;? Don&#8217;t ask me how I know this, but you look an even bigger idiot when you use the term incorrectly in front of someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Playphysio one such area of learning is MDR (that&#8217;s Medical Device Regulation, glad you asked?) In some ways MDR and the people that work in this area seem like:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><p>A <strong>secret society</strong>, a club or an organization whose activities, events, inner functioning, or membership are concealed. The society may or may not attempt to conceal its existence. The term usually excludes covert groups, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agencies\">intelligence agencies</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare\">guerrilla warfare</a> insurgencies, that hide their activities and memberships but maintain a public presence.</p><cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_society</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m only <em>half</em> joking here! MDR practitioners and software companies tend to hide behind large ring binders filled with ISO standards, regional regulations, interlinked legally required processes, operations and monitoring. In honesty, I feel that we do have to respect these professionals it is a significant area to manage and critical for patient safety. But what is particularly challenging is the tacit secrecy around meeting MDR requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently I have found an organisation that ignores the cabal of MDR consulting. If you need MDR in your life/venture/business I&#8217;d head over and take a look at <a href=\"https://www.openregulatory.com/\">Open Regulatory</a> and reach out to <a href=\"https://www.openregulatory.com/about/\">Oliver Eidel</a>.

But Playphysio’s combining physiotherapy with games is being supported by doctors at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge, UK: what does Playphysio know that society doesn’t?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/news/releases/groundbreaking-new-study-says-time-spent-playing-video-games-can-be-good-for-your-wellbeing/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Oxford study</a> has suggested that video games could actually be <em>good </em>for us: they can improve our overall mental well-being. The study found that the more gamers play a game, the more positive they felt. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54954622\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Interestingly, all participants were over 18 years of age</a>. They encourage playing video games as a way that could improve players’ mental health, which proves what Playphysio has known for a long time: games can make your life better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playphysio’s games encourage you into a state of mind that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6134042/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">psychologists call ‘flow’</a>. When we’re in flow, we feel excited, positive, and confident. Hard, concentrated work is, surprisingly, one of the best ways to bring us into this mental state, and this is what video games give us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We choose to play video games, they keep us at the edge of our skill level, and alway push us that little bit harder to do better and reach the next level. Even losing a game makes playing more fun: when your character falls off the rainbow road in your favourite Kart race game with a wail and a dramatic spin, you laugh! You’re not scared of failing, which makes you play better and improve your chances of levelling up (or beating that italian plumber!).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamification has also spread to what’s called Augmented Reality games: games which you play to improve your real life. These games can help you in pretty much any aspect of your daily life: from encouraging your family to do chores to making you less scared of flying. They can also be used to help patients make their treatments more fun, less boring, and more motivating to do every day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s why Playphysio’s physio-games work so well. By turning boring, repetitive, and difficult to measure exercises into a challenge, with clear goals and real-time feedback, it’s easy to become sucked into the game. And once you’re sucked in, you become more positive, more focused, and more motivated to keep playing. This positive reinforcement means that your child is creating a habit of choosing to complete their prescribed treatment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No more fights over how many blows your child thinks they’ve done versus how many you’ve counted, no more tantrums over having to do the exercises <em>again</em>; physio has become fun, all due to gamification. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anna Willis is a freelance journalist.

Parents everywhere enthuse about green vegetables, brushing your teeth, keeping your bedroom tidy! We have to try to <em>sell the activity</em> in such a way to make it sound exciting and enjoyable for our children. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your child has cystic fibrosis, there are many parts of daily treatment that are not fun, and let&#8217;s be honest, they&#8217;re plain boring for our children. Daily physiotherapy takes the most time to complete, and as such, it is usually a flashpoint for regular emotional outbursts for children and parents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time your child is 10 years old you will have had to &#8216;sell the idea&#8217; of doing treatment in 7260 different ways (allowing for Christmas day and your childs&#8217; birthday as a &#8216;day off&#8217; each year). Is this reasonable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A parents of a CF child we have to entertain our children to ensure they stay engaged in completing the whole physiotherapy routine. For many CF children around 10 years of age, treatment routines may last between 15 and 45 minutes, repeated twice a day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will have spend 3630 hours (or 453 working days) continuously entertaining your child to encourage them whilst they do their treatment. You do this because you want them to focus on good technique and get most possible benefit from prescribed treatment. Is this reasonable?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After after 9 years of this routine, I felt that out situation was not reasonable, and something had to change. I also realised I had to make this change myself. So I decided that I had to find some way to make CF physiotherapy fun, in order to help my daughter and our family cope with this relentless burden of care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One morning back in 2013, following another one and a half hour argument over physio with my daughter, I decided that I had to find a way to make daily physio into a fun activity. That was the seed of an idea that has become Playphysio.</p>\n",

The results were announced on the spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each finalist was awarded a grant and access to pro bono support from BWB and one year membership to The House of St Barnabas. Unfortunately Playphysio didn&#8217;t win a grand prize, but we did gain several offers of support from some key individuals and mentors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;d like to congratulate the 2017 winners of the Stephen Lloyd Awards: <a href=\"http://sntech.co.uk/\">Safetynet Technologies</a>, and <a href=\"http://wearesettle.org/\">Settle</a> </p>\n",
