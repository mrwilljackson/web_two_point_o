<p>The James Lind Alliance was established in 2004 with the aim of setting various priorities for people managing chronic medical conditions. It is particularly interesting because its defines priority lists from a shared view from <strong>patients, carers and clinicians.</strong></p>

<p>We believe that Playphysio addresses three of these ten priorities!</p>

<p><strong>The top ten priorities for Cystic Fibrosis include:</strong></p>

<ol ><li><strong><em>What are the effective ways of simplifying the treatment burden of people with Cystic Fibrosis?</em></strong></li></ol>

<p>We believe the transforming physiotherapy which is the most time consuming daily treatment into fun and games, significantly reduces the burden of care for parents, carers and patients! </p>

<ol start="6"><li><strong><em>What effective ways of motivation, support and technologies help people with Cystic Fibrosis improve and sustain adherence to treatment?</em></strong></li></ol>

<p>Playphysio motivates individuals to perform treatment through play and the fun of mobile gaming. Our app supports patients and clinicians by tracking treatment and encouraging great technique.</p>

<p>Everyone with CF is isolated from one another but Playphysio can link all  individuals together through games and even to challenge one another to a game!</p>

<p>Our App guides patients through the complex treatment routines so patients and parents don't loose count of where they are.</p>

<p>With the data gathered by Playphysio, clinicians can address another key priority:</p>

<ol start="4"><li><strong><em>Which therapies are effective in delaying or preventing progression of lung disease in early life in people with Cystic Fibrosis?</em></strong></li></ol>

<p>Playphysio Clinical Dashboard could help care teams identify when a patient may have a problem with keeping up with treatment. This may allow a physiotherapist to make contact with the family to prevent the onset of more serious problems.</p>
