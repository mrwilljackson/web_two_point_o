<p>We're absolutely delighted to announce that Playphysio has been awarded a grant from the Comic Relief and Paul Hamlyn Foundation in the &#8216;Tech for Good' program!</p>

<p>Did you ever realise that your doctors and physiotherapists have no idea if you're actually doing physio or not! This is where Comic Relief have come to the rescue!</p>

<p>Here at Playphysio HQ we believe that it would be a really good idea if physiotherapists and doctors could actually see proof of how well patients are doing with their physio treatment routines. If they did have this information, it could change many aspects of routine care for children and Adults managing CF.</p>

<p>So will be using this grant to build an &#8216;online clinical dashboard' which will be linked to our existing Playphysio App. The &#8216;dashboard' will allow doctors and physiotherapists to see the treatment tracking data from each patient.</p>

<p>This means that <strong>for the first time ever</strong> our CF care teams can see the details of how our family / patients are actually getting on with every physiotherapy session. The CF clinical teams that we've spoken to so far are very excited about this project! </p>

<p>We're now actively seeking research partners to design trials to test out the following benefits:</p>

<ul ><li>Does a record of your treatment improve care?</li><li>How effective is your physio treatment?</li><li>Can we reduce the need for clinic / hospital appointments?</li><li>Can we predict any problems that may need to be addressed with treatment?</li></ul>

<p>We will also be talking to the CF Trust to find out how we might be able to share the physiotherapy treatment data with the national registry to help benefit the entire CF population.</p>
