Last week I was invited to attend [HETTNorth](https://www.hettnorth.co.uk) by [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/patient-participation/) as a [Patient Representative](https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/patient-participation/) and take part in a roundtable discussion. It was clear to me that Public Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) in healthcare / innovation is often seen through different lenses by various stakeholders.

**Patients** appreciate having their voices heard, yet they may harbor concerns about being exploited in the process.

**Innovators** frequently view PPIE as a mere box-ticking exercise for grant applications, questioning its commercial value during the early stages of product development.

**Care providers and hospitals** on the other hand, face challenges in dedicating staff to engage with patients and are constrained by chronic understaffing, data protection issues, etc&#8230;

*I wondered if there is another perspective on PPIE…*

## Patients, innovators, and healthcare providers can all benefit from successful PPIE activities:

**Patients** are excited by new products and technologies that target real-world experiences and unmet needs. User-friendly products deliver high levels of adherence, and engagement strategies significantly improve health outcomes [1]:

**Innovators** often view PPIE as a box-ticking exercise but early engagement with patient groups, advocates, and support organizations provides a direct connection to the target market. This approach reduces time to market and helps prevent wasted resources when there’s no product-market fit. It's a core concept in a &#8216;lean startup' [2]

**NHS and care providers** face significant issues with adherence to prescribed treatments. Particularly in expensive chronic conditions where adherence is around 50% (according to WHO). Medical products and services with high levels of customer/patient satisfaction can deliver high levels of adherence, increasing efficiency and reducing healthcare delivery costs [3]:

</StatsCards>

## A Win-Win-Win Scenario

A View of PPIE from this perspective suggests that all three groups can benefit:

- **Patients** get products that truly meet their needs, leading to better health outcomes.

- **Innovators** gain direct access to their target market, reducing development time and R&D costs.

- **Healthcare providers** see improved treatment adherence, increasing efficiency and reducing management costs.

<KeyInsight>
Effective PPIE is not just about ticking boxes! It's about creating a collaborative environment where patient insights help to drive innovation, leading to better products, improved health outcomes, and more efficient healthcare delivery.
