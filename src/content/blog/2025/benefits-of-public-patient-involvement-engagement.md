<p>Last week I was invited to attend <a href="https://www.hettnorth.co.uk">HETTNorth</a> by <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/patient-participation/">NHS England</a> as a <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/ourwork/patient-participation/">Patient Representative</a> and take part in a roundtable discussion. It was clear to me that Public Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) in healthcare / innovation is often seen through different lenses by various stakeholders. </p>

<p><strong>Patients</strong> appreciate having their voices heard, yet they may harbor concerns about being exploited in the process. </p>

<p><strong>Innovators</strong> frequently view PPIE as a mere box-ticking exercise for grant applications, questioning its commercial value during the early stages of product development. </p>

<p><strong>Care providers and hospitals</strong> on the other hand, face challenges in dedicating staff to engage with patients and are constrained by chronic understaffing, data protection issues, etc&#8230;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>I wondered if there is another perspective on PPIE…</em></p>

<h2 >Patients, innovators, and healthcare providers can all benefit from successful PPIE activities:</h2>

<p><strong>Patients</strong> are excited by new products and technologies that target real-world experiences and unmet needs. User-friendly products deliver high levels of adherence, and engagement strategies significantly improve health outcomes [1]:</p>

</StatsCards>

<p><strong>Innovators</strong> often view PPIE as a box-ticking exercise but early engagement with patient groups, advocates, and support organizations provides a direct connection to the target market. This approach reduces time to market and helps prevent wasted resources when there’s no product-market fit. It's a core concept in a &#8216;lean startup' [2] </p>

  <Stat value="15% increase" label="in adoption of cost-effective technologies that received patient input in health technology assessments" />
</StatsCards>

<p><strong>NHS and care providers</strong> face significant issues with adherence to prescribed treatments. Particularly in expensive chronic conditions where adherence is around 50% (according to WHO). Medical products and services with high levels of customer/patient satisfaction can deliver high levels of adherence, increasing efficiency and reducing healthcare delivery costs [3]:</p>

  <Stat value="30% Increase" label="in guideline adherence by healthcare professionals due to patient involvement in guideline development." />
</StatsCards>

<h2 >A Win-Win-Win Scenario</h2>

<p>A View of PPIE from this perspective suggests that all three groups can benefit:</p>

<ul >
<li><strong>Patients</strong> get products that truly meet their needs, leading to better health outcomes.</li>

<li><strong>Innovators</strong> gain direct access to their target market, reducing development time and R&D costs.</li>

<li><strong>Healthcare providers</strong> see improved treatment adherence, increasing efficiency and reducing management costs.</li>
</ul>

<KeyInsight>
Effective PPIE is not just about ticking boxes! It’s about creating a collaborative environment where patient insights help to drive innovation, leading to better products, improved health outcomes, and more efficient healthcare delivery.
