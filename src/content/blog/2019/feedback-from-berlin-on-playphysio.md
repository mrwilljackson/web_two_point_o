<p>Last week was busy one for me, with two invitations to present. One at Gamification Europe 2019 in Berlin, and the other at Cambridge University's Judge Business School. </p>

<p>I think I'll have to return to Berlin another time to find the famous Christmas markets, the Brandenburg gate etc, as I was rather pre-occupied!</p>

<p>I haven't delivered many presentations to groups that really understand gamification and here were some serious academic and commercial experts in the field! As you might imagine, I was excited and nervous to give my presentation, on the first day of the conference.</p>

<p>One of the many brilliant and talented people attending GE2019 was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aczvdmeer/">Albert van der Meer</a> (co-author of <em><a href="http://aestranger.com/products/publications/books/press-start-gamification-and-marketing/">Press Start: Using Gamification to Power-up your Marketing</a></em>). Albert has written a <a href="http://aestranger.com/reflections-gamification-europe-conference-2019/">review of the entire GE2019 event</a> on his site <a href="http://aestranger.com/reflections-gamification-europe-conference-2019/">aestranger.com</a>. </p>

<p>Personally, I'm very proud and flattered that Albert described my presentation as &#8216;One of the stand outs of the day' and that &#8216;it left everyone with a well of emotions and motivations to help improve the world.' Confirmation for me that my mission was accomplished!</p>

<p>I'd like to share a huge thanks to Albert for sharing his review, and to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jenkinspete/?originalSubdomain=uk">Pete Jenkins</a> of <a href="https://gamificationplus.uk/">Gamification+</a> for inviting me to take part. GE2019 was a brilliant, informative and great fun, and I was absolutely bowled over by the personal feedback from fellow speakers and attendees. It leaves me feeling happy, excited and very energised! </p>
