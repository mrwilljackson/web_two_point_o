<p>Will is going to be sharing his story about Playphysio at Gamification Europe 2019 this December in Berlin. He's being joined by a whole host of gamification industry experts.  Gamification Europe is <em>the</em> place to be for anyone interested in the use of #gamification. Want to join in? Visit <a href="https://gamification-europe.com/">https://gamification-europe.com/</a>  #GEU19 for more information.</p>

<p>The 2019 theme for the conference is ‘Future Fun: Where is Gamification Headed?’ and believe me, we do have some ideas!</p>
