<p>Comic Relief reached out to Playphysio to help raise awareness of <a href="https://www.comicrelief.com/rednoseday">Red Nose Day on Friday March 15th this year</a>. Naturally we were very happy to take part!</p>

<figure><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMUqqefMiJc" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>

<p>As a beneficiary, we're very pleased to be able to help Red Nose Day and Comic Relief and the amazing grant programs that they run.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Tech4Good' grant that Playphysio was awarded is being used to build an online patient dashboard. This will allow doctors and physiotherapists to see childrens' physio data without the need for hospital appointments!</p>

<p>We hope that this physio data will help to inform future medical research into the treatment of cystic fibrosis. Providing better understanding of how effective physiotherapy can be for children with CF. This understanding will help to improve health for all CF patients not just those using Playphysio<sup>Â®</sup>.</p>

<p><em>P.S. A huge thank you to William and his mum Victoria for agreeing to allow the BBC film crew, Comic Relief and Playphysio to take over living room at such short notice! </em></p>
