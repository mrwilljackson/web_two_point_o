<h3 ><strong>Allia announces the Future20. </strong><br><strong>20 exciting companies looking to change the world.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>We have some very exciting news!</strong> We’re thrilled to announce that we have been chosen as one of the Future 20! We’ve joined a new incubator programme from @Allia Future Business Centre along with 19 other startups who are tackling the #GlobalGoals and solving the most pressing issues.</p>

<p>After a national call and an extensive application process, Allia Future Business Centres and its network of partners selected twenty of the very best UK tech for good and social ventures for its new bespoke incubator. </p>

<p>Allia Future Business Centres, the home for social ventures and tech for good, recently held a launch event to announce the chosen ventures and give them an overview of the individual package of strategic support and practical business advice they will be able to access over the next 12-18 months. </p>

<p>Following an overwhelming response of applications from all over the UK, Playphysio won a place on the program and will now benefit from tailored support to refine its business model, scale and accelerate success to create maximum impact. </p>

<p>Support will come from Allia and a network of partners from across the UK tech, innovation and professional service industries. This includes mentorship from select entrepreneurs and angel investors as well as introductions to funders and opportunities to raise capital, plus advice on product development, go-to-market roadmaps and access to testing sites, together with free workspace and prototyping facilities. </p>

<p>Some of the key partners on board to provide a range of support, resources and advice include: Barclays Eagle Labs, J P Morgan, Innovate UK, Stone King, AgeTech Accelerator, Agri-Tech East, Anglian water, Aurora Cambridge, Cambridge Cleantech, Cambridge Wireless, Enterprise Europe Network, The EU Commission, The Health Foundry, Oxford Greentech, Triple Point, Water Innovation Network and the Wellcome Genome Campus. </p>
