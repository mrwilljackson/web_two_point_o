As a beneficiary of a &#8216;Comic Relief Tech for Good' grant Playphysio was delighted to be invited by their storytelling team to take part in a film to show how grants have been used as part of this years build up to Red Nose Day 2019!

We had a great couple of days filming with the BBC team. Heartfelt thanks to the families that volunteered to take part. Also a huge thank you to Anita Rani, who conducted an amazing interview with Edward and his mum to explain how life was before and after using Playphysio. We hope you enjoyed watching The One Show film and this sneak peak behind the scenes!
