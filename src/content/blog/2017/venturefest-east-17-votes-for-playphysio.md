Playphysio is a member of the &#8216;Serious Impact' incubator run by Allia in Cambridge. Allia invited me to take part in VentureFest East 2017 at Newmarket Racecourse Cambridgeshire,  in the &#8216;Meet the Future' session. Representing Playphysio I pitched to VentureFest East attendees for the award &#8216;Impact Entrepreneur 2017'.

The pitching session was opened and introduced by renown angel investor Peter Cowley. The brightest impact entrepreneurs from a variety of different sectors took part such as med-tech, bionics, agri-tech, engineering and even smart cities. After each pitch, the session was open for dynamic Q&A from the VentureFest East audience.

The culmination of the event was the final vote â€“ the audience were asked to move next to their selected winner. (If you remember the 1980's childrens' tv show &#8216;Runaround' you have the right idea!) I'm delighted to report that the Playphysio podium was promptly surrounded by most of the audience!

I was very pleased to receive the prestigious 3d printed Allia "Impact Entrepreneur 2017&#8243; award from Peter Cowley.
