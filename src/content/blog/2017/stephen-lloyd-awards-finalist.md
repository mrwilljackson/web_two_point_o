<p>On 27th June 2017 we set up our demos and presentation at Bates Wells LLP at their London office ready for the Stephen Lloyd Awards finale event.</p>

<p>It was a great evening and I was honoured to be amongst a dozen other social ventures, as we delivered our elevator pitch for 1 minute to the entire audience.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was in a &#8216;market stall' format, where each venture presented a longer pitch for a 5 minutes or so. The attendee's (who were also the judges) were able to choose which presentations they attended but there wasn't enough time to view every single pitch!</p>

<p>It was a fast and furious evening which was great fun and rather exhausting too! The audience then voted for their chosen venture by posting a token in a box at the end of all the pitches. The results were announced on the spot.</p>

<p>Each finalist was awarded a grant and access to pro bono support from BWB and one year membership to The House of St Barnabas. Unfortunately Playphysio didn't win a grand prize, but we did gain several offers of support from some key individuals and mentors.</p>

<p>We'd like to congratulate the 2017 winners of the Stephen Lloyd Awards: <a href="http://sntech.co.uk/">Safetynet Technologies</a>, and <a href="http://wearesettle.org/">Settle</a> </p>
