<p>The NHS Clinical Entrepreneur Program is renowned for its dedication to nurturing innovation within the healthcare sector, offering unparalleled support, mentoring, and resources to healthcare professionals aiming to bring transformative ideas to life. Its goal? To improve patient care and streamline healthcare delivery across the board.</p>

<p>What makes this moment even more special is the fact that I am one of only nine individuals from a patient/carer background to be invited to participate. This inclusion is a testament to the program's recognition of the unique insights and contributions that patients and carers can bring to the healthcare innovation landscape.</p>

<p>As I embark on this exciting journey, I am eager to dive into the entrepreneurial training, mentorship, and network the program offers. I look forward to sharing my learnings and experiences with you, hoping to inspire and engage with others who share a passion for healthcare innovation.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates on this adventure, as I navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. Together, let's explore the potential of patient-led innovation in transforming healthcare for the better.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and encouragement.</p>
