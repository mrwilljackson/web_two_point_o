# 📌 WordPress Sticky Posts Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The PlayPhysio blog now uses WordPress's built-in **"Sticky Posts"** functionality to control which post appears as the featured post at the top of the blog page. This provides much more flexibility than automatically using the most recent post.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **WordPress Admin**
1. **Edit any post** in WordPress admin
2. **Check the "Stick to the front page" checkbox** in the Publish meta box
3. **Update/Publish** the post
4. **The post becomes featured** on the blog page

### **Blog Display Logic**
- **If sticky posts exist**: First sticky post becomes the featured post
- **If no sticky posts**: Featured section is completely hidden
- **Multiple sticky posts**: Only the first one is featured (by date)
- **Regular posts**: All non-sticky posts appear in the main grid

## 📁 Implementation Details

### **Content Utils Functions**
```typescript
// Check if a post is sticky
export function isSticky(post: WordPressPost): boolean {
  return post.sticky === true;
}

// Get all sticky posts
export function getStickyPosts(posts: WordPressPost[]): WordPressPost[] {
  return posts.filter(post => isSticky(post));
}

// Get all non-sticky posts
export function getNonStickyPosts(posts: WordPressPost[]): WordPressPost[] {
  return posts.filter(post => !isSticky(post));
}
```

### **Blog Page Logic**
```javascript
// Get featured post (sticky post) and remaining posts
const stickyPosts = getStickyPosts(posts);
const featuredPost = stickyPosts.length > 0 ? stickyPosts[0] : null;
const remainingPosts = getNonStickyPosts(posts);

// Featured section only shows if there's a sticky post
{featuredPost && (
  <section class="featured-section">
    <!-- Featured post content -->
  </section>
)}
```

## 🎨 User Experience

- **"Featured" badge** clearly identifies the highlighted post
- **Two-column layout** with content on left, image on right

## 🎯 Content Strategy

### **When to Use Sticky Posts**
- **Important announcements** - company news, product launches
- **High-quality content** - research articles, thought leadership
- **Time-sensitive posts** - events, deadlines, campaigns
- **Popular content** - posts that deserve extra visibility

### **Best Practices**
- **One sticky post** - keep it simple and focused
- **Update regularly** - don't let featured content get stale
- **Quality over recency** - feature your best content, not just newest
- **Clear imagery** - sticky posts get prominent image display

## 🔄 Workflow

### **Making a Post Sticky**
1. **Go to WordPress admin** → Posts
2. **Edit the post** you want to feature
3. **In the Publish box** → Check "Stick to the front page"
4. **Update the post**
5. **Rebuild the site** (for static generation)

### **Removing Featured Post**
1. **Edit the sticky post** in WordPress
2. **Uncheck "Stick to the front page"**
3. **Update the post**
4. **Rebuild the site**
5. **Featured section disappears** automatically

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Multiple featured posts** - carousel or grid of sticky posts
- **Category-specific sticky posts** - different featured posts per category
- **Automatic expiry** - time-based sticky post management
- **Featured post analytics** - track engagement on featured content

## 📝 Notes

- **WordPress sticky posts** are different from "pinned" posts in some other CMSs
- **Only published posts** can be made sticky
- **Sticky status** is preserved when posts are updated
- **Category filtering** includes sticky posts in their respective categories
- **Static generation** means changes require a rebuild to take effect

The sticky posts feature provides **editorial flexibility** while maintaining **clean, conditional layouts** that adapt to content strategy needs! 📌✨
